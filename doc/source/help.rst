We are well aware of the steep learning curve of |PACKAGE_NAME|. By
asking your questions you not only give you a chance to solve your
problem quickly, but also help us to improve |PACKAGE_NAME| by letting
us know of what a user finds hard to accomplish with the system.

Apart from the |PACKAGE_HOME| (in particular the |PACKAGE_BOOK|) there
is also help available locally. You can generate a local copy of the
|PACKAGE_HOME| by doing the following
::

   git clone https://github.com/fricas/fricas-doc
   cd fricas-doc
   git clone https://github.com/fricas/fricas
   make here copy
   firefox html/index.html

If you are working with |PACKAGE_NAME| in an operating system that has
the `X Window System <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System>`_
available, you can find most of the information
in HyperDoc (see the |PACKAGE_BOOK| for more information about
HyperDoc), which is started when you start |PACKAGE_NAME|.

In a |PACKAGE_NAME| session there are special commands starting with a
closing parenthesis in the first column. You can get more information
about them by typing

::

  )help help

  )help set

In particular, for the `)set` command you can find the output
`here <http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/FriCASHelpSet>`_.
